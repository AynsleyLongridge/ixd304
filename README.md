## Cocktail Icon set
My cocktail icons are made up of two different sets. The first set I had wanted to create was for the menu of the bar, I wanted to think about ways in which I could include the ingredients to tell the user what the cocktail is made up of. I created icons for each cocktail including the alochol, mixer and garnish. The second set are four more detailed versions of the classic cocktails. During this module I had been thinking alot about where and how these icons could be used, sticking with the idea of them being a part of a bar I thought it would be nice to use these four as a way of advertising special offers in poster form.
